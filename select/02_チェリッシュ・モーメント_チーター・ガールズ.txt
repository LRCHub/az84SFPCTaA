La la la la, la la la la
La la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la
Ooh, baby, cherish the moment
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la!

You, you know the kind
That finger pointing criticize
They can see, or read the sign
That life is really bigger than you and I
But if time, all time
We realize
We're gonna find
That we should all

Cherish the moment
Live for today
We won't get lost
Just to lose your way
We all love the sun
But we still need the rain
So what good is it to run away
It don't change a thing

In this world
There's a flow
You can feel it if you just let go
And if you want
To feel your heart
It will happen if you just don't try so hard
Break it down
Hear the sound
In your soul
Let it surround
All love and we should just

Cherish the moment
Live for today
We won't get lost
Just to lose your way
We all love the sun
But we still need the rain
So what good is it to run away
It don't change a thing
There's only so much time
So why not enjoy it
Why not enjoy the ride, the ride!

La la la la, la la la la
La la la la, la la la la
La la la la la la la
Ooh, baby, cherish the moment
La la la la, la la la la la
La la la la, la la la la la
La la la la la la la la!

Cherish the moment
Live for today
We won't get lost
Just to lose your way
We all love the sun
But we still need the rain
So what good is it to run away
It don't change a thing

Cherish the moment
Live for today
We won't get lost
Just to lose your way
We all love the sun
But we still need the rain
So what good is it to run away
It don't change a thing
